Machine Learning:  Exploring Regression Analysis
**Chosen Dataset**: **Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset**

**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository

**Link**: [Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+ci)
- This dataset is publicly available and has been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of measurements of electric power consumption in a single household over an extended period (from December 2006 to November 2010). The dataset captures various attributes related to power usage, including Global_active_power, Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, and sub-metering values.


**Dataset Overview**
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Number of Instances**: 2,075,259 (rows)
- **Number of Attributes**: 9 (columns)
- **Target Variable**: Global_active_power (continuous)
- **Feature Variables**: Date, Time, Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3.


**Suitability for Regression Analysis**
- This dataset is ideal for regression analysis due to its continuous target variable and the presence of multiple explanatory variables. By using regression models, I aim to predict household power consumption based on the available features, exploring the influence of each feature on the target variable. Additionally, the datasetâ€™s time-series nature allows for the consideration of temporal patterns in power usage, which can further enhance the predictive models.ing power consumption.
